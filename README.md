# 3DRayCaster-Improved
An Improved version of the previous 3d Runner Repo where I've added textures, a better map and ofcourse you can open doors, literally!

Hey!

So this version is just an upgrade of my previous repo, 3DRunner which was a very rudamentry 3D Woflenstine Ray casting game engine.
I've added textures to make it a little less boring, a better map that shows you where your going and in which direction and a 
feature that enables you to open doors.


The controls are -> a for LEFT Rotate(CCW)
                 -> a for Down
                 -> w for UP
                 -> d for Right Rotate(CW)
                 -> e for Open Door
             
             
Colision Detection is present so you cannot venture off into the abbys just like the previous version


Note: I've used the OpenGL library here instead the windows library in this version, the library package should be downloaded (it's present in the repo) 
      and put into the right folder location
